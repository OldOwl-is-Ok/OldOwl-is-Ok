Please don't call me arrogant, conceited... (laughs...) OldOwl-is-Ok, literally means... OldOwl can be used here...as a nickname. 

But d'ont worry,,, I'am really cool... (laughs).. 

I'm 65 years old, and I'm from the old guard of programmers... In the distant time when we used Cobol as a programming language.

Today I return to the world of computers, as an apprentice of web tools... (markup, style, and programming).

I thank everyone in the community who strive to make all existing knowledge accessible and I hope to be an active part of this group. 

Hugs.
